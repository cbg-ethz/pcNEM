        Propagation Networks to reconstruct phenotypic hierarchies
Version: 2.46.0
Author: Sumana Srivatsa, Niko Beerenwinkel
Description: The package ‘pcnem’ allows to reconstruct networks from combinatorial perturbations by modelling perturbations probabilistically. It takes as input (1.) a set of pathway components, which were perturbed, (2.) a probabilistic perturbation map defining the probabilities of perturbing each component, and (3.) phenotypic readout of these perturbations (e.g. gene expression, protein expression). The output is a directed acyclic graph representing the phenotypic hierarchy.
