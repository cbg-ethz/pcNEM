Package: pcnem
Title: Probabilistic combinatorial nested effects model
Version: 2.46.0
Author: Sumana Srivatsa, Niko Beerenwinkel
Description: The package 'nem' allows to reconstruct features of pathways from the nested structure of perturbation effects. It takes as input (1.) a set of pathway components, which were perturbed, and (2.) phenotypic readout of these perturbations (e.g. gene expression, protein expression). The output is a directed graph representing the phenotypic hierarchy.
