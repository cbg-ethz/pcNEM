# pcNEM
Probabilistic combinatorial nested effects model (pc-NEM), is a variant of NEM, which probabilistically models the perturbations 
for network reconstruction from combinatorial gene knockdown data. The model and the inference algorithm are implemented as part of the R/Bioconductor package _nem_. This package will soon be merged with the existing _nem_ package.

For installation:

install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

install_github("cbg-ethz/pcNEM")
